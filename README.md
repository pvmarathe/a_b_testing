# a_b_testing
This repository will have everything I learn about a/b testing 


Today my focus is gonna be on a Brick and Mortar retailer who also has an online presence. Let me call this retailer as PM.

Business Problem/Context: Testing Product Page Layouts

Goal: Increase the number of people adding items to the cart

Version A: Current Product Page (standard photos + basic description)
Version B: Enhanced Product Page (more photos, 360 degree view, customer video)

Metric: Add to cart rate

Solution:
